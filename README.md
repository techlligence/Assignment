This assignment has been completed with the following architecture:
- SpringBoot 3.4.3
- Java 17
- SpringBoot JPA
- H2 DB - For local testing
- Liquibase - For DB Schema Orchestration and Migration
- Lombok - Some cool boilerplate syntactic sugar
- Docker - to lift and shift

For retrieving the user information as per assignment requirements, I have exposed appropriate rest endpoints. I coded this within a 2 hour timelimit, however, did not get to the following:
- Writing Unit Testing
- Properly testing the CRUD operations, I was running into some DB primary key indexing issue.

The assignment was fun :)
